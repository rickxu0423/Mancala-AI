# mancala_ai

# use command: 'python3 play.py' to run the game

# the first prompt asks you to put into the mode for player1 which will go first

# the second prompt asks you to put into the mode for player2 which will go after player 1

# game contains 4 types of player-mode:
#   1. human
#   2. random
#   3. minimax
#   4. minimax_alpha_beta

# if you choose the player-mode other than human, every move chosen by the algorithm will be prompted and you should simply press 'Enter' to go to the next turn

# although the algorithm is limited by its search depth to 9, it is pretty hard for a human to beat a minimax or alpha_beta player

# the estimated time for the first move of a minimax player is around 30s, be patient, it will become faster and faster when the game goes

# please have fun with it!
