## Mancala_AI

Use command: **python3 play.py** to run the game.

The first prompt asks you to type into the mode for **player1** which will go first and the second prompt asks you to type into the mode for **player2** which will go after player 1.

## Game contains 4 types of player-mode:
    1. human
    2. random
    3. minimax
    4. minimax_alpha_beta

If you choose the player-mode other than human, every move chosen by the algorithm will be prompted and you should simply press **Enter** to go to the next turn.

Although the algorithm is limited by its search depth to **9**, it is pretty hard for a human to beat a minimax or alpha_beta player.

The estimated time for the first move of a minimax player is around **30s**, be patient, it will become faster and faster when the game goes.

**Please have fun with it!**
